### How does prototypal inheritance differ from classical inheritance?

#### Answer

In the classical inheritance paradigm, object instances inherit their properties and functions from a class, which acts as a blueprint for the object. Object instances are typically created using a constructor and the `new` keyword.

In the prototypal inheritance paradigm, object instances inherit directly from other objects and are typically created using factory functions or `Object.create()`. Finally, object instances can be composed from many different objects, allowing for selective inheritance.

#### Good to hear

* Classes create hierarches and taxonomies.
* Prototypal inheritance allows for a flat prototype delegation hierarchy.
