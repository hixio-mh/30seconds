### How to write comments in React?

#### Answer

The comments in React are similar to JavaScript multiline comments which are wrapped with curly braces. When using JSX they look like this:

```jsx
render() => (<div>
  {/* single-line comments */}
  Hey {user}, write cool comments
  {/* multi-line
  comments */}
</div>)
```
